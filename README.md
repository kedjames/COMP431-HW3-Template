# COMP431-HW3-Client-Server
In this assignment you will extend your parsing and file-listing program from Homework 1 to operate over a network. Specifically, you will split your Homework 1 solution into two programs; one of which will be a client program and the other will be a server program. The server program will behave much as the original Homework 1 program did â€” it will read lines of input, identify valid HTTP GET requests and attempt to process all valid requests. However, whereas Homework 1 performed all I/O to standard input and standard output, your server program will perform all I/O to a TCP socket. The client program will interact with the user reading a line of input from standard input, send the line to the server program over a socket connection, receive a response line(s) from the server, echo all output from the server to standard output, and then wait for another line of input from the user. A separate new socket should be created for each interaction between the client and the server.
